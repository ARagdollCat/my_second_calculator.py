# my_second_calculator.py
This is an expanded version of [AceLewis'](https://github.com/AceLewis) [my_first_calculator.py.](https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py) with more numbers, operators, and 162,803 more lines. It is easy to add more numbers but you will probably crash, right now it is set from -50 to 50. The file size is 7.8MB.

I will probably add more in the future
